# Political-Polarization
Respository of AI Ethics project, on political polarization in twitter data.

As part of Dr. Malihe Alikhani's CS1699 AI Ethics course, Zhiyi Zhan and I completed a finally project, compiling a data corpus of twitter data consisting of various hashtags that have been present in the news and in popular culture. These will help to train models of Dr. Alikhani's design.

Zhiyi ran a separate examination on Twitter data, using NLP to compare sentiment around the topic of COVID as compared for March of this year to last year.

Comments on how to run the model (Sentiment.ipynb):
The current errors shown is because when I was running them, the file wasn't there. 
The files for process are COVIDpt1/2/3/4.csv, COVIDMar2021Part1/2/3/4,csv, all located in the folder CSVfiles. They have to be uploaded to the folder sample_data(or other, just change the path). The files get deleted every time the notebook is closed.
