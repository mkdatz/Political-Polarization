1383164223547699208 2021-04-16 17:03:43 -0400 <POTUS> I just wrapped up my first in-person bilateral meeting as president with Japanese Prime Minister Suga. Tune in as we hold a joint press conference.  https://t.co/0qDrhSod5f

1383108404835708933 2021-04-16 13:21:55 -0400 <POTUS> I’m looking forward to welcoming my friend Prime Minister Suga to the White House this afternoon for the first foreign leader visit of my presidency — and to renewing the historic alliance between the United States and Japan.

1382409575668854789 2021-04-14 15:05:01 -0400 <POTUS> We went to Afghanistan because of the horrific attacks on 9/11 that happened 20 years ago.  That cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021.  Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges of the future.
1382403602065592321 2021-04-14 14:41:17 -0400 <POTUS> It is time to end America’s longest war.   It is time for American troops to come home from Afghanistan.

1382128972243210242 2021-04-13 20:30:00 -0400 <POTUS> Today, the FDA and CDC recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. Here’s what you need to know:  https://t.co/QVtrEkqO8F

1382074869047820290 2021-04-13 16:55:01 -0400 <POTUS> “When the will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, when honor scorns to compromise with death — that is heroism.” — R.G. Ingersoll   Capitol Police Officer William Evans was a hero.  https://t.co/Xtius0vq0z
1382060825289048067 2021-04-13 15:59:12 -0400 <POTUS> Race should never determine health outcomes — and pregnancy and childbirth should be safe for all. But for too many Black women, safety and equity have been denied. This Black Maternal Health Week, our Administration is taking action to change that.  https://t.co/9s33KmLSdv
1381775395905802244 2021-04-12 21:05:01 -0400 <POTUS> We can’t let the divisions of the moment stop us from doing right by our future. That’s why this afternoon, I brought together a bipartisan group of lawmakers to discuss how we can build America’s infrastructure back better with the American Jobs Plan.  https://t.co/OT3gSXQcU2
1381765708653207557 2021-04-12 20:26:31 -0400 <POTUS> As the crescent moon ushers in the month, Jill and I send our warmest greetings and best wishes to Muslim communities in the United States and around the world. Ramadan Kareem.
1381744189680062465 2021-04-12 19:01:01 -0400 <POTUS> Today I’m thinking about Daunte Wright and his family — and the pain, anger, and trauma that Black America experiences every day. While we await a full investigation, we know what we need to do to move forward: rebuild trust and ensure accountability so no one is above the law.
1381636731426979847 2021-04-12 11:54:00 -0400 <POTUS> When I served as Vice President, I asked to be the last person with the President before big decisions were made — and @VP is providing the same counsel to me. She’s the last voice in the room and never fails to speak the truth as we work to build our nation back better.  https://t.co/I4EXm204l3
1381326182155714564 2021-04-11 15:20:00 -0400 <POTUS> It’s time we invest in the future of America once again.
1381275665710911488 2021-04-11 11:59:16 -0400 <POTUS> Our progress on vaccinations is proof that there’s nothing America can’t achieve when we do it together.  https://t.co/51fKUzciVJ
1381026709248602115 2021-04-10 19:30:00 -0400 <POTUS> Gun violence in this country is an epidemic — and it’s long past time Congress take action.
1380962571361128453 2021-04-10 15:15:08 -0400 <POTUS> This isn’t complicated.  https://t.co/4Fei10Vjih
1380889206499721217 2021-04-10 10:23:37 -0400 <POTUS> The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in the future of America. For this episode of our weekly conversation, I invited members of my Jobs Cabinet to break down their favorite parts.  https://t.co/Kyn0lEmVW1
1380666838292566017 2021-04-09 19:40:00 -0400 <POTUS> A new study put out just last week found that at least 55 of our largest corporations used various loopholes to pay $0 in federal income taxes in 2020.  It’s not fair to the rest of the American taxpayers — and we’re going to put an end to it.
1380641708782850048 2021-04-09 18:00:09 -0400 <POTUS> High-speed internet is essential infrastructure in the 21st century.  https://t.co/1vAeHdAUQ2
1380611589171216389 2021-04-09 16:00:28 -0400 <POTUS> I’m excited to share my official portrait — and honored to serve as your president every day.  https://t.co/JIe5mDJK5a
1380571945574535173 2021-04-09 13:22:56 -0400 <POTUS> Universal background checks are supported by the vast majority of Americans — and the majority of gun owners.  So let’s be clear, this is not a partisan issue. It’s an American issue.
1380544282029883394 2021-04-09 11:33:00 -0400 <POTUS> Prince Philip’s legacy will live on not only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavors he shaped. Jill and I are keeping the Queen and Prince Philip’s children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the people of the United Kingdom in our hearts during this time.
1380319248506044416 2021-04-08 20:38:48 -0400 <POTUS> I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one. But even here, there’s much more common ground than some would have us believe.  https://t.co/ZtN0Zr0rBf
1380301939783708672 2021-04-08 19:30:01 -0400 <POTUS> We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country.   There’s no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine. None.
1380291160296587265 2021-04-08 18:47:11 -0400 <POTUS> We need more than “thoughts and prayers” from Congress. It’s time to act.  https://t.co/BT4VQlyYsD
1380258362416365577 2021-04-08 16:36:52 -0400 <POTUS> On this Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember the precious lives we lost and honor those who survived to bear witness. We must all give anti-Semitism and hate no safe harbor and ensure the atrocities of the Holocaust never occur again.
1380244052239605764 2021-04-08 15:40:00 -0400 <POTUS> The Senate should immediately pass the three House-passed bills to close loopholes in the gun background check system.  That is one of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence and save lives.
1380237838579564546 2021-04-08 15:15:18 -0400 <POTUS> My Administration is taking initial steps to reduce gun violence, including:  - Stopping the proliferation of ghost guns - Regulating pistols modified with a stabilizing brace - Helping states adopt red flag laws - Supporting community violence interventions
1380187546148339717 2021-04-08 11:55:28 -0400 <POTUS> Today, I’m joining Vice President Harris and Attorney General Garland to announce new actions to reduce gun violence. Tune in.  https://t.co/p6dgJRYKwe
1380177945839419394 2021-04-08 11:17:19 -0400 <POTUS> Whatever partisan divisions there are around other issues — there don’t have to be on infrastructure.  We’re one nation — united and connected.  https://t.co/oSdugebDuc
1379954737366327305 2021-04-07 20:30:22 -0400 <POTUS> It’s time we focus on our nation’s caregiving infrastructure — the kind of infrastructure that helps people build a better life and carve out their place in the middle class.  https://t.co/B91j2Pj4kQ
1379943395305664516 2021-04-07 19:45:18 -0400 <POTUS> We need to start seeing infrastructure through the eyes of working people.  https://t.co/ohYa2PBsOr
1379932003638861827 2021-04-07 19:00:02 -0400 <POTUS> Two hundred years ago trains weren’t “traditional” infrastructure either — until America made the choice to lay the tracks.
1379921373028564996 2021-04-07 18:17:47 -0400 <POTUS> The idea of infrastructure has always evolved to meet the aspirations of the American people — and it’s evolving again today.  https://t.co/AgJAdN4HML
1379912737103486979 2021-04-07 17:43:28 -0400 <POTUS> We are America.   We don’t just fix for today.   We build for tomorrow.
1379892894786523139 2021-04-07 16:24:37 -0400 <POTUS> Above all, infrastructure is about meeting the needs of the nation and putting Americans to work to get the job done.
1379857925875888128 2021-04-07 14:05:40 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I’m delivering remarks on the historic infrastructure investments in the American Jobs Plan. Tune in.  https://t.co/oxOiRtLI8C
1379601287927447552 2021-04-06 21:05:53 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I stopped by a vaccination clinic at the Virginia Theological Seminary. It’s an example of the kind of partnerships we’re seeing around the country — people coming together across different faiths to serve those most in need. It’s America at its best.  https://t.co/iiT8r1OVnp
1379581687131168772 2021-04-06 19:48:00 -0400 <POTUS> According to the latest CDC data, almost 80 percent of pre-K through 12 teachers, school staff, and childcare workers received at least one shot by the end of March. That is great progress in protecting our educators – our essential workers.
1379569480444080129 2021-04-06 18:59:29 -0400 <POTUS> Despite the progress we’re making as a nation, I want every American to know in no uncertain terms that the fight against COVID-19 isn’t over.  https://t.co/gZTkXC7czX
1379532894859882498 2021-04-06 16:34:07 -0400 <POTUS> By April 19, every adult will be eligible to be vaccinated.
1379528431671648257 2021-04-06 16:16:23 -0400 <POTUS> I’m proud to share that yesterday, we crossed 150 million shots in just 75 days of my Administration — on our way to hitting our goal of 200 million shots by my 100th day in office.
1379527093952909318 2021-04-06 16:11:04 -0400 <POTUS> My Administration is working to get America vaccinated as quickly as possible. Tune in as I provide an update on our progress and the timeline moving forward.  https://t.co/bHCeCGPLHr
1379482785438703618 2021-04-06 13:15:00 -0400 <POTUS> It’s time to rebuild America.
1379442293774684160 2021-04-06 10:34:06 -0400 <POTUS> Now is not the time to let up in our fight against COVID-19. We have to hold the line while everyone gets vaccinated. Keep wearing a mask, stay socially distanced, and wash your hands.  Let’s fight this to the end.
1379277683885015042 2021-04-05 23:40:00 -0400 <POTUS> Congrats to the Baylor Bears on their National Championship — and to the Gonzaga Bulldogs on a great season. After an unimaginable year, every team in the tournament proved what’s possible with hard work and determination. You made your schools, communities, and country proud.
1379194637320126471 2021-04-05 18:10:00 -0400 <POTUS> Broadband is infrastructure.
1379175265562136582 2021-04-05 16:53:01 -0400 <POTUS> Our Easter celebrations looked different this year, like they did for so many others across the country. But we look forward to next year when the White House will ring with the joy of the season — and God willing, there’ll be an Easter Egg Roll once again.  https://t.co/WscouTQZwk
1379148484415217666 2021-04-05 15:06:36 -0400 <POTUS> Here’s the deal: Wall Street didn’t build this country — the great American middle class did. It’s time we rebuild the middle class and bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.
1379118640193228805 2021-04-05 13:08:01 -0400 <POTUS> Although this year looks different, the rich history of Easter at the White House carries on. Tune in as I deliver remarks.  https://t.co/bLvYAow5yJ
1378890020241694720 2021-04-04 21:59:34 -0400 <POTUS> Congratulations to @StanfordWBB on their NCAA Women's Basketball Championship win, and to @ArizonaWBB on a hard-fought season.   This year, every college team went through a uniquely challenging season but Coach VanDerveer's team shows how grit and tenacity can prevail.
1378716622878298113 2021-04-04 10:30:32 -0400 <POTUS> From our family to yours, we wish you health, hope, joy, and peace. Happy Easter, everyone!  https://t.co/3NHPrbFCVt
1378501570086760450 2021-04-03 20:16:00 -0400 <POTUS> My Administration is working to get America vaccinated as quickly as possible. And this week, we took additional steps to make vaccines more accessible. By April 19, 90% of Americans will live within 5 miles of a place to get a shot.
1378458328725086214 2021-04-03 17:24:10 -0400 <POTUS> The American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid.  https://t.co/QzIuRNfsZP
1378434305962221569 2021-04-03 15:48:43 -0400 <POTUS> I can’t believe I have to say this, but giant corporations shouldn’t pay less in taxes than a teacher or a firefighter.   We’re going to change that – and ensure corporations finally pay their fair share with the Made in America Tax Plan.
1378406335742672898 2021-04-03 13:57:34 -0400 <POTUS> The American Jobs Plan will: - Modernize 20,000 miles of highways and roads - Repair 10,000 bridges in need of upgrade - Build new rail corridors and transit lines - Reduce bottlenecks at our ports and airports - Tackle the climate crisis
1378346805407141892 2021-04-03 10:01:01 -0400 <POTUS> This week, I announced the American Jobs Plan, which will invest in our infrastructure and strengthen America’s competitiveness for decades to come. My team and I answered your questions about the plan. Tune in.  https://t.co/1psECeHfSs
1378128727519997953 2021-04-02 19:34:27 -0400 <POTUS> If we act now, people are going to look back and say, “This was the moment that America won the future.”  https://t.co/zxR5BQ0lYz
1378109389073170435 2021-04-02 18:17:37 -0400 <POTUS> The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation investment in the future of America.  https://t.co/HioujkkMv9
1377792787211505666 2021-04-01 21:19:33 -0400 <POTUS> A Cabinet that looks like America.  https://t.co/XZNOSTE2GJ
1377765217841655816 2021-04-01 19:30:00 -0400 <POTUS> The American Jobs Plan will make sure every single American has access to high quality, affordable, high-speed internet.
1377727792960393218 2021-04-01 17:01:17 -0400 <POTUS> The American Jobs Plan will ensure every American can turn on the faucet or fountain and drink clean water.  https://t.co/V1WT3TkISS
1377699408909860866 2021-04-01 15:08:30 -0400 <POTUS> I am convinced that if we act now with the American Jobs Plan, in fifty years people will look back and say this was the moment America won the future.
1377428415716950023 2021-03-31 21:11:40 -0400 <POTUS> Two years ago, I began my campaign in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to rebuild the backbone of America.  Today, I returned as president to lay out a vision for how we do that.  We’re going to rebuild the middle class — and this time, we’re going to bring everyone along.  https://t.co/hSNbI08mDF
1377402906157084681 2021-03-31 19:30:18 -0400 <POTUS> Let me be clear: We’re going to ensure corporations finally pay their fair share.  https://t.co/k5Kz1NaLdi
1377389132775743488 2021-03-31 18:35:34 -0400 <POTUS> The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs, grow our economy, make us more competitive, promote our national security interests, and put us in a position to win the global competition with China.  https://t.co/yaVX6MDB3M
1377367570831921152 2021-03-31 17:09:53 -0400 <POTUS> Historically, infrastructure has been bipartisan.   There is no reason it can’t be bipartisan again.  The divisions of the moment shouldn’t stop us from doing right by the future.
1377366973290590211 2021-03-31 17:07:31 -0400 <POTUS> In 2019, an independent analysis found that there were 91 Fortune 500 companies that used various loopholes to pay $0 in federal income taxes on U.S. income.   That’s just wrong — and we will put an end to it with the Made in America Tax Plan.
1377362312865017856 2021-03-31 16:49:00 -0400 <POTUS> The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we have seen or done since we built the Interstate Highway System and won the Space Race decades ago.  It’s big. It’s bold. And we can get it done.
1377361852385042432 2021-03-31 16:47:10 -0400 <POTUS> Here’s the truth: We all do better when we all do well.  It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out — not the top down.
1377358899746115599 2021-03-31 16:35:26 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I’m in Pittsburgh to discuss the American Jobs Plan. Tune in.  https://t.co/LK83Jslm9L
1377338684706488322 2021-03-31 15:15:06 -0400 <POTUS> In the 21st century, in the wealthiest nation in the world, everyone should have access to high speed internet — no matter where they live. We can make that possible.  https://t.co/Txaw0n7axh
1377331110099570688 2021-03-31 14:45:00 -0400 <POTUS> I’m on my way to Pennsylvania to discuss my economic vision for the future and how we’re going to build back better for the American people. See you soon, Pittsburgh!
1377322916451381252 2021-03-31 14:12:27 -0400 <POTUS> Infrastructure isn’t just about roads and bridges — it’s about our global competitiveness. And as we continue to fall back, the rest of the world is closing in. We can’t allow this to continue. We have to invest in America again.  https://t.co/wEOcJ3JObf
1377311230717726727 2021-03-31 13:26:01 -0400 <POTUS> Over the last few months, we’ve seen the rising cost of our aging power grid firsthand. We can modernize it, make it greener, and create millions of jobs — all at the same time. Let’s do this.  https://t.co/zpgatQ63vb
1377296082506547202 2021-03-31 12:25:49 -0400 <POTUS> Far too many Americans lack access to affordable public transit — and those who do have access are often met with delays and disruptions. We have the power to change that, modernize public transit, and expand access for people across the country.  https://t.co/qVfxAm1QTd
1377255646651908102 2021-03-31 09:45:08 -0400 <POTUS> Transgender rights are human rights — and I’m calling on every American to join me in uplifting the worth and dignity of transgender Americans. Together, we can stamp out discrimination and deliver on our nation’s promise of freedom and equality for all. #TransDayofVisibility
1377239825984671744 2021-03-31 08:42:17 -0400 <POTUS> Every single American has a right to clean drinking water. It’s just plain wrong that in the United States of America today, millions of children still receive their water through lead service pipes. It’s long past time we fix that.  https://t.co/l6UpUOkErr
1377059201613238272 2021-03-30 20:44:32 -0400 <POTUS> The Paycheck Protection Program has served as a crucial lifeline for small businesses during this pandemic. Today, I signed the bipartisan PPP Extension Act of 2021 to extend the application deadline and ensure more small businesses can get the support they need.  https://t.co/A3KRgmjVmu
1376990021517983755 2021-03-30 16:09:39 -0400 <POTUS> Nominating judges who reflect America is a top priority. That’s why today I announced 11 nominees — the earliest any administration has announced this many judges in modern history. They represent the best of the legal profession and the diversity that makes our nation strong.  https://t.co/Zr7ywGpRLe
1376966204615749645 2021-03-30 14:35:00 -0400 <POTUS> There is nothing America can’t do if we put our minds to it.  https://t.co/7ngUvEF3RW
1376931500852187143 2021-03-30 12:17:06 -0400 <POTUS> We can’t be silent in the face of rising violence against Asian Americans. That’s why today I’m taking additional steps to respond–including establishing an initiative at the Department of Justice to address anti-Asian crimes.  These attacks are wrong, un-American, and must stop.
1376700955295686667 2021-03-29 21:01:00 -0400 <POTUS> We have a sacred obligation to care for our nation’s veterans and their families. The American Rescue Plan will help deliver on that obligation by ensuring access to VA health care and providing immediate economic relief.
1376693154867515402 2021-03-29 20:30:00 -0400 <POTUS> In the next three weeks, we will more than double the number of pharmacies where you can get vaccinated and increase the number of federally-run mass vaccination sites.   We’re going to make sure that 90% of Americans live within 5 miles of a vaccination site by April 19.
1376687510894620672 2021-03-29 20:07:34 -0400 <POTUS> This Vietnam War Veterans Day, and every day, we remember the brave members of our armed forces who sacrificed so much in service of our nation. We owe them and their families more than we could ever repay.  https://t.co/77TEfX6OF8
1376663734681268228 2021-03-29 18:33:06 -0400 <POTUS> We’ve made enormous progress when it comes to COVID-19, but new variants are spreading quickly. Now is not the time to let up — we have to hold the line while we get the country vaccinated.  Wash your hands. Stay socially distanced. Wear a mask. Get vaccinated when you can.
1376637789119336454 2021-03-29 16:50:00 -0400 <POTUS> Over the last three days, we have had a record number of shots in arms with nearly 10 million shots recorded.  That would have been inconceivable in January.
1376610861603774466 2021-03-29 15:03:00 -0400 <POTUS> I’m proud to announce that three weeks from today, 90% of adults will be eligible to get vaccinated — and 90% of Americans will live within 5 miles of a place to get a shot.
1376602772116807680 2021-03-29 14:30:51 -0400 <POTUS> Vice President Harris and I just wrapped up a COVID-19 briefing. Tune in as I give an update on our response to the virus and the state of vaccinations.  https://t.co/eAex72VFDH
1376304348205047808 2021-03-28 18:45:01 -0400 <POTUS> That’s a big deal.  https://t.co/4mmFW8f3ps
1376240170052227075 2021-03-28 14:30:00 -0400 <POTUS> I urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. We need to make it easier for all eligible Americans to access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote.
1376196131777089546 2021-03-28 11:35:00 -0400 <POTUS> Two weeks ago, I directed all states, tribes, and territories to make all adult Americans eligible for the vaccine no later than May 1 — and we’re already making progress.  https://t.co/w6Ly5AVkks
1375923985834246154 2021-03-27 17:33:36 -0400 <POTUS> If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.  https://t.co/KpisgmD2xX
1375809947754233857 2021-03-27 10:00:27 -0400 <POTUS> Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue. This week, the First Lady and I sat down with Megan Rapinoe and Margaret Purce to discuss our progress in the fight for equal pay and the work that lies ahead.  https://t.co/ESQgwxD6gm
1375594667476127745 2021-03-26 19:45:00 -0400 <POTUS> On this National Day of Action and Healing, my Administration stands united with the Asian American community in the face of rising violence. Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It must stop — and it’s on all of us together to make it stop.
1375562706401566726 2021-03-26 17:38:00 -0400 <POTUS> The Georgia voting law — like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country — is a blatant attack on the right to vote, the Constitution, and good conscience.  It’s Jim Crow in the 21st Century — and it must end.
1375548396161937418 2021-03-26 16:41:08 -0400 <POTUS> As we recall the Passover story of overcoming adversity, finding hope, and becoming free, we find a renewed salience. This weekend, as Seders close with the familiar refrain, “Next year in Jerusalem,” we offer an additional prayer: Next year in person. Next year, together.  https://t.co/TBU2dXMPCQ
1375542122217095171 2021-03-26 16:16:12 -0400 <POTUS> A strong European Union is in America’s interest. That's why yesterday, I met with @CharlesMichel and the @EUCouncil to revitalize U.S.-EU relations, as we partner up to combat COVID, tackle the climate crisis, and ensure democracies rather than autocracies set rules of the road.  https://t.co/a9QlGRh4DP
1375481512603308033 2021-03-26 12:15:22 -0400 <POTUS> I ran for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of the nation, rebuild the middle class, and unite the country.  https://t.co/LibS0bX1R6
1375447854366482437 2021-03-26 10:01:37 -0400 <POTUS> I set a goal to have the majority of K-8 schools reopened within my first 100 days. And I’m happy to report, we’re on track to meet and exceed that goal.  https://t.co/v8mDsGAkoA
1375287567218708488 2021-03-25 23:24:42 -0400 <POTUS> Today, I congratulated @PrimeministerGR on the bicentennial of Greek independence. From defense and energy to trade and investment, our close relationship is stronger today than ever.
1375251732201054209 2021-03-25 21:02:18 -0400 <POTUS> Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy.  https://t.co/EZys2d0aG7
1375228591630381057 2021-03-25 19:30:21 -0400 <POTUS> The Republican efforts to block Americans from voting are sick, pernicious, and despicable.  https://t.co/bWTnxfYimt
1375217896599732225 2021-03-25 18:47:51 -0400 <POTUS> Communities across the country are struggling because of COVID-19 — but help is here. The American Rescue Plan provides funding to ramp up vaccinations, safely reopen schools, lift up small businesses, and move forward.
1375203730396696577 2021-03-25 17:51:34 -0400 <POTUS> On this National Medal of Honor Day, we recognize the brave service members whose heroism and courage earned them our nation’s highest military decoration. We must never forget their acts of valor and the sacrifices they made in defense of our country.
1375195174150807557 2021-03-25 17:17:34 -0400 <POTUS> As of yesterday, more than 100 million $1,400 payments have gone into people’s bank accounts — real money in people’s pockets. Help is here.  https://t.co/jdJ2iOiirv
1375156812052316164 2021-03-25 14:45:07 -0400 <POTUS> Today, I’m setting a new goal: 200 million shots in arms by my 100th day in office.  https://t.co/1zCPzq5gG0
1375143694777597958 2021-03-25 13:53:00 -0400 <POTUS> Before I took office, I set a big goal of 100 million shots in my first 100 days.   We hit the goal on day 58.   Now, I’m setting a new one: 200 million shots in my first 100 days.   Let’s do this.
1375142384401530883 2021-03-25 13:47:48 -0400 <POTUS> I’ve been hired to solve problems, not create divisions.
1375137304566657026 2021-03-25 13:27:36 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I’m holding my first formal press conference as president. Tune in.  https://t.co/dvl1RAtOjr
1374914278336167941 2021-03-24 22:41:23 -0400 <POTUS> Equal Pay Day is a big deal around here. Right, @mPinoe and @100purcent?  https://t.co/wYdJkp9QYa
1374897577548775428 2021-03-24 21:35:01 -0400 <POTUS> Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and it’s long overdue. As president, I’m committed to closing the gap once and for all.  https://t.co/nJkEWCyCoo
1374880343065509890 2021-03-24 20:26:32 -0400 <POTUS> It doesn’t matter if you’re an electrician, an accountant, or part of the best soccer team in the world — the pay gap is real. But with Megan, Margaret, and countless others leading the fight for equal pay, I’m confident we’ll finally close it.  https://t.co/lJOTc0HeVB
1374874167926009859 2021-03-24 20:02:00 -0400 <POTUS> The pandemic and economic crisis have greatly impacted women and families — but with the American Rescue Plan, help is here. The law increases the Child Tax Credit, cuts child poverty in half, expands child care assistance, and provides funding to open K-8 schools.
1374857492149178368 2021-03-24 18:55:44 -0400 <POTUS> 66% of the tax breaks in the American Rescue Plan go to folks making $90,000 or less.  The top one percent get zero.  https://t.co/vPMlFSCDmS
1374839011571867649 2021-03-24 17:42:18 -0400 <POTUS> We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and ensure every worker is treated with dignity and respect. As the new Secretary of Labor, @SecMartyWalsh will play a crucial role in that effort. I know he’ll fight every single day for the hardworking Americans who make our country run.
1374827497221615617 2021-03-24 16:56:33 -0400 <POTUS> To mark Equal Pay Day, @FLOTUS and I are hosting an event with Megan Rapinoe, Margaret Purce, and members of the U.S. Soccer Women’s National Team. Tune in.  https://t.co/fZBqoOLBv5
1374803594613043201 2021-03-24 15:21:34 -0400 <POTUS> Ambassador Bill Burns has dealt with many of the most complex global challenges we face — and approached them with honesty, integrity, and skill. I know that’s exactly how he’ll lead the CIA every single day.
1374780774772310019 2021-03-24 13:50:53 -0400 <POTUS> This morning, I signed the SAVE LIVES Act into law — expanding the VA’s authority and allowing them to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to all veterans, their spouses, and caregivers.  https://t.co/oAO3GCsnEX

1374568909215518722 2021-03-23 23:49:00 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon in Columbus, I met with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to discuss our coordinated response to COVID-19. The virus doesn’t just impact red or blue states — it impacts us all — and I’m committed to working across the aisle to defeat it.  https://t.co/ghcDxs6FW3
1374562480932937729 2021-03-23 23:23:28 -0400 <POTUS> Before the Affordable Care Act, the radiation oncology department at the James Cancer Center treated 60-70 patients a day. Now, they’re able to treat close to 300. The hospital is a source of hope for the community and an example of what America can achieve if we work together.  https://t.co/SlzUyCDRjo
1374536387320483842 2021-03-23 21:39:47 -0400 <POTUS> When we opened a special enrollment period for health insurance in February, over 200,000 Americans gained coverage in the first two weeks. Today, we’re extending the enrollment period to August 15.   Head to  https://t.co/gRX1fGFEzj to find a plan that works best for you.  https://t.co/Xv4Or7PsYu
1374523608853143553 2021-03-23 20:49:00 -0400 <POTUS> When it comes to trade, we need to pursue policies that put American businesses, workers, and communities first. There’s no one better qualified to carry out that mission than @AmbassadorTai.
1374512536901414916 2021-03-23 20:05:00 -0400 <POTUS> I believe every American deserves access to quality, affordable health care. The American Rescue Plan is working to make that a reality by increasing subsidies, lowering costs, and expanding coverage for people across the country. Help is here.
1374506865149677576 2021-03-23 19:42:28 -0400 <POTUS> Small businesses are the backbone of communities across the country, but far too many are struggling to keep their doors open. I know @SBAIsabel will work every day to support our small businesses and help them emerge stronger from this pandemic.
1374479845309128706 2021-03-23 17:55:06 -0400 <POTUS> Today marks eleven years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.

1374419422232805376 2021-03-23 13:55:00 -0400 <POTUS> We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.   We can close loopholes in our gun background check system.   This is not a partisan issue — it’s an American issue that will save lives. Congress needs to act.
1374413644352548874 2021-03-23 13:32:02 -0400 <POTUS> There is a great deal we do not know about the killer, his motivation, and other critical aspects about this shooting, but know this: as president, I will use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe.
1374413643081682956 2021-03-23 13:32:02 -0400 <POTUS> Jill and I are devastated for the lives that have been shattered by gun violence in Colorado.

1374089124983025666 2021-03-22 16:02:31 -0400 <POTUS> The faster America gets vaccinated, the sooner we can return to our lives with our loved ones. That’s why I’m proud to share we set another record this weekend with 6 million shots reported administered across the country.
1374060809869987847 2021-03-22 14:10:00 -0400 <POTUS> There are simply some core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans. One of them is standing together against racism — the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation.  It’s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor in America.
1374005447456403458 2021-03-22 10:30:01 -0400 <POTUS> Under the American Rescue Plan, the typical family of four is getting a $5,600 check. That money helps folks keep a roof over their head and put food on the table. Help is here.

1373061783355858956 2021-03-19 20:00:14 -0400 <POTUS> Silence is complicity — and we cannot be complicit.  We have to speak out. We have to act.  https://t.co/zJXEoKXOMm
1373046355879460865 2021-03-19 18:58:55 -0400 <POTUS> Too many Asian Americans have been waking up each morning this past year fearing for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.  https://t.co/LI3iLREoMr

When I was a kid and working to overcome my stutter, I would recite Yeats’ words in the mirror. I’m glad they’ve helped you as well, Brayden, and I’m incredibly proud of how far you’ve come.

1370819489391124492 2021-03-13 14:30:09 -0400 <POTUS> To everyone out there who’s hurting or struggling to get by: help is here.  https://t.co/fkME0yMmBK

1370453161010462725 2021-03-12 14:14:30 -0400 <POTUS> This is the United States of America. There’s nothing we can’t do if we do it together.  https://t.co/ekS0dPRnUR
1370440001792655368 2021-03-12 13:22:12 -0400 <POTUS> Attorney General Merrick Garland is a man of impeccable character. I know he’ll work every day to reaffirm the integrity and independence of the Justice Department and build a more equitable justice system for all Americans.
1370427184754655237 2021-03-12 12:31:16 -0400 <POTUS> Over a year ago no one could’ve imagined what we were all about to live through, but now we are coming through it. It’s a shared experience that binds us together as a nation.  https://t.co/CT7gl3p5KD
1370224248879452162 2021-03-11 23:04:53 -0400 <POTUS> Tonight, I am announcing that I will direct all states, tribes, and territories to make all adult Americans eligible for the vaccine no later than May 1.  https://t.co/FEIDCFLORb
1370201703300149254 2021-03-11 21:35:17 -0400 <POTUS> In the loss, we’ve seen how much there is to gain — in appreciation, respect, and gratitude.  Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do.  https://t.co/MSTpMEPEBe
1370186033950826504 2021-03-11 20:33:01 -0400 <POTUS> If we all do our part, then by July 4th, there’s a good chance folks will be able to gather with family and close friends to celebrate Independence Day.
1370186032495394820 2021-03-11 20:33:01 -0400 <POTUS> Finally, we need every American to do their part — including getting vaccinated when it’s their turn and helping family, friends, and neighbors get vaccinated as well.
1370186031291588609 2021-03-11 20:33:01 -0400 <POTUS> Fourth, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated — to lessen the confusion, keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated.
1370186030104649732 2021-03-11 20:33:01 -0400 <POTUS> Third, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan, and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, we can accelerate the massive nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely.
1370186029181853696 2021-03-11 20:33:00 -0400 <POTUS> Second, when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch new tools to make it easier for you to find a vaccine — including a website that will help you find a place to get a vaccination near you.
1370186027835518977 2021-03-11 20:33:00 -0400 <POTUS> First, I’m directing all states, tribes, and territories to make all adult Americans eligible for the vaccine no later than May 1.
1370186026526838788 2021-03-11 20:33:00 -0400 <POTUS> For all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back — and to get our economy back on track — is to beat the virus.  Here are the next steps we’re taking to make that happen:
1370183387915423750 2021-03-11 20:22:31 -0400 <POTUS> We are proving once again something I have said time and time again: It is never a good bet to bet against the American people.  This nation is coming back.
1370182351326752771 2021-03-11 20:18:23 -0400 <POTUS> I will use every power I have and I will not relent until we beat this virus.  But I need you. I need every American to do their part.  Get vaccinated when it’s your turn, keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing masks.
1370181634146832384 2021-03-11 20:15:32 -0400 <POTUS> All adult Americans will be eligible to get the vaccine no later than May 1.
1370181473337274369 2021-03-11 20:14:54 -0400 <POTUS> Before I took office, I set a bold goal of administering 100 million shots in my first 100 days.  I’m proud to share that we’re well ahead of schedule and on track to reach that goal by day 60.
1370178240287887362 2021-03-11 20:02:03 -0400 <POTUS> One year ago today, everything stopped because of COVID-19. Tune in as I deliver remarks on the progress we’ve made and the path that lies ahead.  https://t.co/ffCllTxkLr

1370164481272205319 2021-03-11 19:07:23 -0400 <POTUS> The last year has tested us in unimaginable ways, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.  We will emerge stronger.  https://t.co/FJUnsVoKXX
1370129068423794692 2021-03-11 16:46:40 -0400 <POTUS> Before I took office, I promised you that help was on the way. Today, I signed the American Rescue Plan into law, and can officially say: help is here.  https://t.co/uuEZAkGloz

1370030504305713153 2021-03-11 10:15:00 -0400 <POTUS> One in four adults in the U.S. has received their first COVID-19 vaccine — and we’re now leading the world in vaccinations.  That’s progress.
1369854343965536260 2021-03-10 22:35:00 -0400 <POTUS> During World War II, one of our country’s slogans was “Together, we can do it.” And companies took it to heart.  We need that same kind of wartime effort today.  That’s why we brought together Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, and the federal government to defeat COVID-19.  https://t.co/wz2vxn6Bj1
1369834567411109891 2021-03-10 21:16:25 -0400 <POTUS> Housing should be a right — not a privilege. But far too many people are struggling to keep a roof over their head. I look forward to working with @SecFudge to help renters and homeowners get through this crisis and ensure every American has access to quality, affordable housing.
1369793471058444290 2021-03-10 18:33:07 -0400 <POTUS> Checks are on the way.  https://t.co/rtODFOZ4OX

1369426527893528576 2021-03-09 18:15:01 -0400 <POTUS> From launching community vaccination centers around the country to deploying mobile vaccination units to hard-to-reach areas — the American Rescue Plan will help vaccinate America quickly and equitably.  https://t.co/j05KQLPti0
1369386260964532225 2021-03-09 15:35:01 -0400 <POTUS> I want every child to know that this is what vice presidents and generals in the United States Armed Forces look like.  https://t.co/y2OFL1z29r
1369341211039961095 2021-03-09 12:36:00 -0400 <POTUS> I believe every worker deserves a free and fair choice to join a union — and the PRO Act will bring us closer to that reality. I urge Congress to send it to my desk so we can summon a new wave of worker power and create an economy that works for everyone.
1369333027038494722 2021-03-09 12:03:29 -0400 <POTUS> The American people need direct economic relief — and they need it now.
1369091474554490883 2021-03-08 20:03:38 -0400 <POTUS> On this #InternationalWomensDay, I signed two executive orders to establish the White House Gender Policy Council and ensure education free from sexual violence.

1369058575167946755 2021-03-08 17:52:54 -0400 <POTUS> Our Administration will honor the visionary women — known and unknown — who have helped build this country. And we’ll be guided by the belief our nation is at its best when there are endless possibilities for all women and girls. #WomensHistoryMonth  https://t.co/pJ9byDgc59
1369035982159290368 2021-03-08 16:23:08 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I’m delivering remarks on International Women’s Day with Vice President Harris, Defense Secretary Austin, and two Combatant Commander nominees. Tune in.  https://t.co/MJgoHWrTGI
1369030877905305608 2021-03-08 16:02:51 -0400 <POTUS> Women’s history is American history — and world history. On #InternationalWomensDay, we celebrate the achievements, contributions, and progress of women and girls — and recommit ourselves to the cause of equity and equality for women around the world.
1368993395172139014 2021-03-08 13:33:54 -0400 <POTUS> We can contain this virus. We can vaccinate America. We can begin to return to our normal lives.  Congress needs to pass the American Rescue Plan to get it done.
1368951833872510978 2021-03-08 10:48:45 -0400 <POTUS> From rolling out the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to securing enough doses for every American by the end of May — last week was a big week, but we still have further to go. Please keep wearing masks, stay socially distanced, and get vaccinated when it’s your turn.
1368703393670303744 2021-03-07 18:21:32 -0400 <POTUS> On this 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I signed an executive order to promote voting access. The right to vote is sacred and fundamental – and this is just the beginning of our work to ensure every American can freely exercise that right.  https://t.co/wKQq640FPB
1368671664402296840 2021-03-07 16:15:28 -0400 <POTUS> It’s time we pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and ensure every eligible American can make their voice heard at the ballot box.
1368603143639101448 2021-03-07 11:43:11 -0400 <POTUS> The legacy of Selma is that while nothing can stop free people from exercising their most sacred power as citizens, there are those who will do anything they can to take that power away. As we reflect on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, we must stay focused on the work ahead.  https://t.co/DDn1LFfqmi
1368363309326606341 2021-03-06 19:50:10 -0400 <POTUS> What will the American Rescue Plan do for you?  https://t.co/ck7UYW0lvv
1368331890692923401 2021-03-06 17:45:19 -0400 <POTUS> The House should pass the American Rescue Plan quickly to get checks out the door starting this month.  https://t.co/ru9PPhSxyT
1368323079336845315 2021-03-06 17:10:18 -0400 <POTUS> By passing the American Rescue Plan, we will have proved that this government can still do what it most has to do: Improve the lives of the American people.  https://t.co/wB3XBnn8RD
1368304452625698817 2021-03-06 15:56:18 -0400 <POTUS> I want to thank all of the Senators who worked so hard to reach a compromise and voted to pass the American Rescue Plan.  It wasn’t easy — but it was so desperately needed.  https://t.co/YPTJggPCyB
1368298301313982466 2021-03-06 15:31:51 -0400 <POTUS> When I was elected, I said we were going to get the government out of the business of battling on Twitter and back into the business of delivering for the American people.    Passing the American Rescue Plan will do that.
1368282189734043650 2021-03-06 14:27:50 -0400 <POTUS> When I took office, I promised help was on the way. Thanks to @SenSchumer and Senate Democrats, we've taken one more giant step forward in delivering on that promise.  I hope the American Rescue Plan receives a quick passage in the House so it can be sent to my desk to be signed.
1368276516220534784 2021-03-06 14:05:17 -0400 <POTUS> Today, the Senate passed the American Rescue Plan – bringing us one step closer to delivering much-needed relief. Tune in as I deliver remarks.  https://t.co/wX8fXNGYqi

I gave her a call to discuss how the American Rescue Plan will deliver direct relief and help her family get through this crisis.  https://t.co/kZR2aSd9HQ
1368003933709467648 2021-03-05 20:02:08 -0400 <POTUS> Another week in the books.  https://t.co/Q2u8fSS86Q
1367981124144730112 2021-03-05 18:31:30 -0400 <POTUS> Everyone in America who wants the COVID-19 vaccine should be able to get it free of charge.  The American Rescue Plan will make that a reality.
1367961367882444800 2021-03-05 17:13:00 -0400 <POTUS> Native American communities have been hit hard by COVID-19. But thanks to the Indian Health Service and strong partnerships with Tribal governments, organizations, and urban Indian groups, more than 500,000 vaccines have already been administered with more on the way.
1367934137357660160 2021-03-05 15:24:47 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I’m sitting down with folks to listen to their stories and discuss how they’ll benefit from the American Rescue Plan. Tune in.  https://t.co/6vsbnZieWj

1367562666529738760 2021-03-04 14:48:42 -0400 <POTUS> The right to vote is sacred and fundamental — and H.R. 1 is urgently needed to protect that right, to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and to repair and strengthen our democracy. I look forward to signing it into law after it has passed through the legislative process.
1367476175698878466 2021-03-04 09:05:01 -0400 <POTUS> Building back better every day.  https://t.co/dBxbxPsOLf

1367242883519029251 2021-03-03 17:38:00 -0400 <POTUS> A plan for all of America — supported by the majority of America.
1367186127992537103 2021-03-03 13:52:28 -0400 <POTUS> On February 15, my Administration opened a special enrollment period for health insurance and more than 200,000 Americans have already gotten covered. It’s an encouraging sign, but we have further to go. Head to  https://t.co/gRX1fGFEzj before May 15 to get covered.
1367120577492885506 2021-03-03 09:32:00 -0400 <POTUS> An educator is leading the Department of Education once again. I look forward to working with @SecCardona to safely reopen our nation’s schools and ensure every child has access to a quality education.

1366947547223326722 2021-03-02 22:04:26 -0400 <POTUS> The countless leaders who turned to Vernon Jordan for guidance did so because when he spoke, you could hear in his rich baritone the belief in an America that was capable of becoming an ever-more perfect union. It was a journey he’d lived.  https://t.co/wE4A16zAUy
1366879571124121606 2021-03-02 17:34:19 -0400 <POTUS> The bottom line is this: We need the American Rescue Plan now.  https://t.co/Aop0DoFych
1366874180784959488 2021-03-02 17:12:54 -0400 <POTUS> The fight against COVID-19 is a war-time effort — and to win, we need breakthrough approaches.

1366863876206264327 2021-03-02 16:31:57 -0400 <POTUS> Today, I am directing every state to prioritize educators for vaccination. We want every educator, school staff member, and child-care worker to receive at least one shot by the end of this month.  It’s time to treat in-person learning like the essential service that it is.
1366863233538228233 2021-03-02 16:29:24 -0400 <POTUS> Three weeks ago, I announced we would have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July.  Now, with our efforts to ramp up production, we will have enough vaccines for every American by the end of May.

1366812548088086532 2021-03-02 13:08:00 -0400 <POTUS> The fact is that $600 is not enough. The Senate needs to pass the American Rescue Plan and finish the job of delivering $2,000 in direct relief.

1366542519220207618 2021-03-01 19:15:00 -0400 <POTUS> During Women's History Month, let us honor the accomplished and visionary women who have helped build our country.

1366191901196644354 2021-02-28 20:01:46 -0400 <POTUS> Workers in Alabama – and all across America – are voting on whether to organize a union in their workplace. It’s a vitally important choice – one that should be made without intimidation or threats by employers.  Every worker should have a free and fair choice to join a union.  https://t.co/2lzbyyii1g
1366087000676331529 2021-02-28 13:04:56 -0400 <POTUS> The more people that get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic.

1365342110132633604 2021-02-26 11:45:00 -0400 <POTUS> The week before I took office, 6 million COVID-19 vaccine shots were administered.  This coming week, our Administration will likely administer over 12 million shots.  That’s double the pace in just six weeks.
1365317466822434819 2021-02-26 10:07:05 -0400 <POTUS> COVID-19 vaccinations are up and cases and hospitalizations are down, but let me be clear: now is not the time to relax.  https://t.co/oUuHCXl3s7

1364984502133657602 2021-02-25 12:04:00 -0400 <POTUS> I am pleased that the House will vote next week on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I encourage the House to pass it. Following Senate consideration, I hope to be able to sign into law a landmark police reform bill.

1364727308020514822 2021-02-24 19:02:00 -0400 <POTUS> Wearing a mask is one of the most important things we can do to protect others and change the course of this pandemic. That’s why over the next few weeks, we’re delivering over 25 million masks to community health centers, food pantries, and soup kitchens across the country.
1364704243446341633 2021-02-24 17:30:21 -0400 <POTUS> Just over a month ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country. That changed the moment we took office.  https://t.co/RPEf6Ce16b

1364590577879244802 2021-02-24 09:58:41 -0400 <POTUS> Small businesses need relief, but many were muscled out of the way by big companies last year.

1361805275141984256 2021-02-16 17:30:53 -0400 <POTUS> Starting this week, our Administration is:  - Increasing weekly vaccine shipments to states to 13.5 million doses — a 57% increase from when I took office. - Doubling our direct shipments to local pharmacies.  We’re working hard to get America vaccinated quickly.
1361736716948811777 2021-02-16 12:58:27 -0400 <POTUS> Mask up, America.  https://t.co/hkVFUh8v6K
1361675449064128513 2021-02-16 08:55:00 -0400 <POTUS> Before I took office, I set a big goal of administering 100 million shots in the first 100 days. With the progress we’re making I believe we’ll not only reach that, we’ll break it.
1361428681311326212 2021-02-15 16:34:26 -0400 <POTUS> Health care is a right — and I will do everything in my power to ensure that all Americans have access to quality, affordable care. Starting today, we’re opening a special enrollment period for health insurance. Head to  https://t.co/gRX1fGFEzj to get covered.
1361371519096602624 2021-02-15 12:47:17 -0400 <POTUS> On this Presidents’ Day, I promise you as your president, my whole soul is in the work ahead of us. And if we do it together, as one nation, we will not fail. America never has.  https://t.co/m8QGdWezch
1361087997446418436 2021-02-14 18:00:41 -0400 <POTUS> The love of my life and the life of my love. Happy Valentine’s Day, Jilly.  https://t.co/LjLLIjvP1C
1361068202395107329 2021-02-14 16:42:01 -0400 <POTUS> Three years ago today, a lone gunman took the lives of 14 students and three educators in Parkland, Florida. In seconds, the lives of dozens of families were changed forever. As we mourn with the Parkland community, we mourn for all who have lost loved ones to gun violence.  https://t.co/k050oDHXIi
1361051528614789123 2021-02-14 15:35:46 -0400 <POTUS> Congratulations, Prime Minister Mario Draghi. I look forward to working closely with you to deepen our strong bilateral relationship, cooperate during your leadership of the G20, and address global challenges from COVID to climate change.
1360990937606983691 2021-02-14 11:35:00 -0400 <POTUS> From COVID-19 to the economic crisis, we’re facing enormous challenges — and faith-based and community organizations are essential to addressing them. That’s why today, I reestablished the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Let’s get to work.
1360699117270413315 2021-02-13 16:15:24 -0400 <POTUS> America’s governors and mayors understand the fight against COVID-19 and the urgency of another relief bill. Yesterday, I met with a bipartisan group of them to discuss the American Rescue Plan and how we can work together to meet the crises we face.  https://t.co/QpJqaKQFuM
1360605123727212546 2021-02-13 10:01:54 -0400 <POTUS> Samir and Neal own NaanStop in Atlanta, Georgia — and like many small businesses around the country, they’ve been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. I gave them a call to hear their story and talk about how the American Rescue Plan will help businesses like theirs.  https://t.co/9FjudVGsMJ
1360385704442949635 2021-02-12 19:30:01 -0400 <POTUS> I know the last year has been difficult and painful for all of us. I hope Jill’s Valentine’s Day message helped brighten your day.  https://t.co/jdEFMSDefm
1360376138506321920 2021-02-12 18:52:00 -0400 <POTUS> It’s also a goal we can meet if we follow the science. Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided the best available scientific evidence on how to reopen schools safely.  https://t.co/IQVWO6iT0B
1360376137457795076 2021-02-12 18:52:00 -0400 <POTUS> Before taking office, I set a goal of opening most K-8 schools by the end of my first 100 days. It’s a national imperative—one that can only be achieved if Congress provides states and communities the resources they need to get it done safely through the American Rescue Plan.
1360346714293620740 2021-02-12 16:55:05 -0400 <POTUS> Earlier this week, Vice President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination site in Arizona. Because of the hard work of these folks — and countless others across the country — we’re going to beat this virus once and for all.  https://t.co/xekXB967h5
1360272714641121283 2021-02-12 12:01:02 -0400 <POTUS> From the Biden family to yours, happy #LunarNewYear. We wish you happiness, health, and prosperity in the Year of the Ox.  https://t.co/sOHEzdFH0D
1360242279898877956 2021-02-12 10:00:06 -0400 <POTUS> I see enormous pain in this country. A lot of folks are out of work. A lot of folks are going hungry, staring at the ceiling at night wondering, “What am I going to do tomorrow?” That’s why I’m urging Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan and deliver much-needed relief.  https://t.co/nROFWbZ44V
1360068619233804290 2021-02-11 22:30:02 -0400 <POTUS> To everyone at the NIH — all the doctors, scientists, and researchers fighting this pandemic and saving lives — thank you from the bottom of my heart. You're truly the best America has to offer.  https://t.co/lLpdZSLdjX
1360058795947393026 2021-02-11 21:51:00 -0400 <POTUS> When I took office three weeks ago, America didn’t have a plan or enough supplies to vaccinate most of the country. But my team got right to work, and as of today, we’ve increased weekly vaccine shipments by nearly 30% and purchased enough vaccines to vaccinate all Americans.
1360027584705294338 2021-02-11 19:46:58 -0400 <POTUS> If we don’t take action, we won’t return to full employment until 2025.  If we pass the American Rescue Plan, we’ll return to full employment next year.  The choice couldn’t be clearer.  https://t.co/Y4w9wzxgyh
1359991640774103040 2021-02-11 17:24:09 -0400 <POTUS> This morning, I met with a bipartisan group of Senators to discuss the need to invest in modern and sustainable infrastructure. This isn’t a partisan issue — and I’m committed to working across the aisle to deliver infrastructure and jobs to communities across the country.  https://t.co/H2sdrRWndn
1359981328490405889 2021-02-11 16:43:10 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I’m visiting the National Institutes of Health and delivering remarks to staff. Tune in.  https://t.co/dyIijetOaP
1359972175768412165 2021-02-11 16:06:48 -0400 <POTUS> No child should grow up in poverty. The American Rescue Plan will expand the child tax credit and cut the child poverty rate in half.  https://t.co/cMw8wCY2N6
1359881972244508674 2021-02-11 10:08:22 -0400 <POTUS> We can reduce suffering in this country, put people back to work, and gain control of this virus.  That’s what the American Rescue Plan will do.  https://t.co/vFxjLCbpj9
1359702455815196676 2021-02-10 22:15:02 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I visited the Department of Defense to meet with officials and deliver remarks to the incredible service members and civilians. Serving as Commander in Chief is the honor of my lifetime and an enormous responsibility — one that I promise I will never take lightly.  https://t.co/u6JLUEnDs8
1359692096693817347 2021-02-10 21:33:52 -0400 <POTUS> I spoke today with President Xi to offer good wishes to the Chinese people for Lunar New Year. I also shared concerns about Beijing’s economic practices, human rights abuses, and coercion of Taiwan. I told him I will work with China when it benefits the American people.
1359655341944930309 2021-02-10 19:07:49 -0400 <POTUS> The risk isn't that we do too much when it comes to a COVID relief package — it's that we don't do enough.  We have to go big.
1359595670835929092 2021-02-10 15:10:42 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I’m visiting the @DeptofDefense and delivering remarks to our service members. Tune in.  https://t.co/ReOiTXXeDj
1359568526336425984 2021-02-10 13:22:50 -0400 <POTUS> I’m delivering remarks on our Administration’s response to the coup in Burma. Tune in.  https://t.co/GV9xYrUcNV
1359551604236648450 2021-02-10 12:15:36 -0400 <POTUS> We’re facing an economic crisis caused by a public health crisis — and we need bold action to address both. That’s why I’m urging Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan.  https://t.co/jnmtVFVIlk
1359517506558447617 2021-02-10 10:00:06 -0400 <POTUS> Let me be clear: No one should lose their home in the middle of this pandemic. Congress needs to pass the American Rescue Plan to extend the ban on evictions and foreclosures and help millions of Americans keep a roof over their head.  https://t.co/hJucMQjTxr
1359344341102309377 2021-02-09 22:32:00 -0400 <POTUS> This afternoon, I met with business leaders from across the country to discuss the state of our economy and the American Rescue Plan. I’m confident that by working together, we’ll get the economy growing again and get the American people back on their feet.  https://t.co/0SmUe0lUxh
1359337903898439680 2021-02-09 22:06:26 -0400 <POTUS> The most sacred obligation our government has is to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into war — and to care for them when they return home. I know @DenisMcDonough will work to fulfill that obligation every single day as our Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
1359283475677929474 2021-02-09 18:30:09 -0400 <POTUS> We can’t stand by as millions of Americans struggle to put food on the table. Congress needs to immediately pass the American Rescue Plan to extend and invest in critical food programs.  https://t.co/GksnfKJ5si
1359261295653097475 2021-02-09 17:02:01 -0400 <POTUS> Now is the time for a big, bold COVID relief package that will change the course of the pandemic and jumpstart our economy. The American people agree.  https://t.co/BSbswr6x1R
1359203978710573065 2021-02-09 13:14:15 -0400 <POTUS> There’s so much more work to be done, but we’ve been able to increase vaccine distribution by 28% in the first three weeks alone. We won’t rest until we make vaccines available to every American.
1359154789108641798 2021-02-09 09:58:48 -0400 <POTUS> Launching a national vaccination program to quickly and equitably vaccinate America — that’s the American Rescue Plan.  https://t.co/DY3JvuXhuY
1358967693366468609 2021-02-08 21:35:21 -0400 <POTUS> I know a lot of folks out there are losing hope, so I want to make one thing clear: I’m going to act as fast as I can to get Americans the relief they so desperately need.  https://t.co/4gohgWCeEx
1358949993512636423 2021-02-08 20:25:01 -0400 <POTUS> Lawrence — Thank you for your service to our nation and for continuing to serve as an example of what we can all do to protect our fellow Americans.
1358907212828184577 2021-02-08 17:35:01 -0400 <POTUS> Funding 100,000 public health workers to contain COVID-19 and vaccinate America — that’s the American Rescue Plan.  https://t.co/rLYxmxRQE7
1358862815235248130 2021-02-08 14:38:36 -0400 <POTUS> At sites across the country, folks are hard at work vaccinating their communities. And this afternoon, @VP Harris and I are virtually touring a COVID-19 vaccination site in Glendale, Arizona. Tune in.  https://t.co/gwAz6SqBWk
1358834233184288770 2021-02-08 12:45:01 -0400 <POTUS> Making vaccines free and accessible for every American — that’s the American Rescue Plan.  https://t.co/5GpH0VYWIE
1358781381984325632 2021-02-08 09:15:01 -0400 <POTUS> We don’t have a second to waste when it comes to delivering the American people the relief they desperately need. I’m calling on Congress to act quickly and pass the American Rescue Plan.
1358640953024778241 2021-02-07 23:57:00 -0400 <POTUS> Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on their #SuperBowl victory — a team whose season was a story of resilience, reinvention, and grit.
1358591489534754819 2021-02-07 20:40:27 -0400 <POTUS> Every year service members around the world gather to watch the Super Bowl — and tonight, I called into watch parties in Kabul and on the USS Nimitz to thank them for their service. We are forever in debt to those who sacrifice so much to keep us safe.  https://t.co/kVmVm8BekS
1358536715166703616 2021-02-07 17:02:47 -0400 <POTUS> For your family, for your neighbors, for your country — wear a mask.
1358452966815072265 2021-02-07 11:30:00 -0400 <POTUS> Everyone who wants a vaccine should be able to get one free of charge. The American Rescue Plan will make that a reality.
1358212634269655041 2021-02-06 19:35:01 -0400 <POTUS> From using the Defense Production Act to contain COVID-19 to taking action to reunite families separated at the border — it was another busy week.  https://t.co/Z4DYMvWUvQ
1358150975320707072 2021-02-06 15:30:00 -0400 <POTUS> If I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting and getting bogged down in a lengthy negotiation — it’s an easy choice.  I'm going to help the American people who are hurting.
1358083335508082690 2021-02-06 11:01:13 -0400 <POTUS> Last year, Michele lost her job because of the pandemic. I recently gave her a call to hear her story and discuss how my American Rescue Plan will help families like hers.  https://t.co/SAqM2GytPf
1357881451937685504 2021-02-05 21:39:01 -0400 <POTUS> Second full week is in the books.  https://t.co/PaTyszWFFU
1357855276943171586 2021-02-05 19:55:00 -0400 <POTUS> We can reduce suffering in this country. We can put people back to work. We can gain control of this virus.  Congress needs to pass the American Rescue Plan to get it done.
1357839901157445633 2021-02-05 18:53:54 -0400 <POTUS> This morning, I met with House Democratic leaders to discuss the American Rescue Plan. As I said during the meeting: this isn’t just about numbers, it’s about people’s lives. Folks are really hurting, and we need to move quickly to deliver the relief they need.  https://t.co/QeyfbX05Ha
1357811991243608065 2021-02-05 17:03:00 -0400 <POTUS> The Family and Medical Leave Act has helped many Americans take time off to care for themselves and their families, but it leaves far too many people forced to choose between a paycheck and caregiving. This has to change.  We need a national paid family and medical leave program.
1357767292080312322 2021-02-05 14:05:23 -0400 <POTUS> America is back. Diplomacy is back.  https://t.co/03dFPQyYjw

With their help, the United States will again lead not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.  https://t.co/0VyLgrMIAX
1357523590367838209 2021-02-04 21:57:00 -0400 <POTUS> The fight against cancer is personal for my family, like it is for millions. But I’m confident that with the strength of dedicated scientists and researchers, tireless health care workers, and brave families like yours, we’ll win this fight once and for all. #WorldCancerDay
1357470610809638913 2021-02-04 18:26:28 -0400 <POTUS> I know folks are wondering how we’ll vaccinate America and get life back to normal — so we had Dr. Fauci answer those important questions and much more.  https://t.co/5EB1aQ5Pmp

1357335570880618496 2021-02-04 09:29:52 -0400 <POTUS> Every American deserves the dignity and respect that comes with the right to union organize and collectively bargain. The policy of our government is to encourage union organizing, and employers should ensure their workers have a free and fair choice to join a union.
1357149496854126592 2021-02-03 21:10:29 -0400 <POTUS> Tonight, the House took an important step toward passing a COVID relief package and getting help to Americans who need it most. I’m grateful for @SpeakerPelosi’s continued leadership as we work to get this pandemic under control and build our economy back better.
1357139313310466048 2021-02-03 20:30:01 -0400 <POTUS> This morning, I met with a group of Democratic Senators to discuss the American Rescue Plan and how we emerge from the crises we face.

1357105335685775360 2021-02-03 18:15:00 -0400 <POTUS> Let me be clear: The risk in this moment isn’t that we do too much — it’s that we don’t do enough. Congress must pass the American Rescue Plan to change the course of this pandemic and start our economic recovery.
1357046199858118659 2021-02-03 14:20:01 -0400 <POTUS> Officer Brian Sicknick was a hero who died in the line of duty defending our democracy and the citadel of liberty itself. To his family and loved ones, I know no words can dull the pain of this moment, but know Jill and I and the entire nation join you in mourning his loss.  https://t.co/hH0Da0NIkQ
1357027337318064129 2021-02-03 13:05:04 -0400 <POTUS> History made. Congratulations, @SecretaryPete — now let’s get to work building our nation’s infrastructure back better, creating good-paying, union jobs, and addressing the climate crisis.
1356984539231485954 2021-02-03 10:15:00 -0400 <POTUS> A Cuban refugee, Secretary Mayorkas understands to his core the importance of welcoming those seeking safety and a better life. I look forward to working with him at the Department of Homeland Security to keep Americans safe and live up to our values as a nation.
1356961889612365825 2021-02-03 08:45:00 -0400 <POTUS> No one should lose their home in the middle of this pandemic. My American Rescue Plan will extend the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures and provide emergency relief to those who need it.
1356792025220276224 2021-02-02 21:30:01 -0400 <POTUS> It’s simple: We are stronger when we welcome immigrants — not shut them out.  https://t.co/aF43c65cDI
1356773535608430594 2021-02-02 20:16:33 -0400 <POTUS> Families belong together. Period.  https://t.co/5xWHGQ2Mk2
1356758073025691651 2021-02-02 19:15:06 -0400 <POTUS> To meet the moment and crises we’re facing, my American Rescue Plan will help contain the virus, deliver direct relief to hardest hit Americans, and dig us out of this economic crisis.  https://t.co/XiC9rqSL1N
1356710332748677122 2021-02-02 16:05:24 -0400 <POTUS> I promised immediate action and I kept my word.  https://t.co/QzTUmCEuZg
1356698359612981253 2021-02-02 15:17:49 -0400 <POTUS> Each and every generation of immigrants has made our nation stronger — our diversity is one of our greatest strengths. Today, I’ll take action to rebuild and strengthen our immigration system.
1356678782288019461 2021-02-02 14:00:02 -0400 <POTUS> It’s long past time we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The American Rescue Plan will get it done.
1356603297172500485 2021-02-02 09:00:05 -0400 <POTUS> We will be judged for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era.   Will we rise to the occasion? Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children?   I believe we must and I believe we will.  https://t.co/DcKyw3yO0r
1356430639680151553 2021-02-01 21:34:00 -0400 <POTUS> We’ve never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, but our Administration is committed to finishing the work left undone. It’s long past time to confront deep racial inequities and systemic racism and fulfill the promise of America for all. #BlackHistoryMonth
1356301789864349699 2021-02-01 13:02:00 -0400 <POTUS> Hardworking Americans need help and they need it now. That’s why I’m calling on Congress to immediately pass my American Rescue Plan that will deliver direct relief, extend unemployment insurance, help folks put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads, and more.
1356239632057430018 2021-02-01 08:55:00 -0400 <POTUS> We’re facing an economic crisis brought on by a public health crisis, and we need urgent action to combat both. My American Rescue Plan will dig us out of the depths of these crises and put our nation on a path to build back better.
1356078800845627402 2021-01-31 22:15:55 -0400 <POTUS> Grateful for the short commute on days like these.  https://t.co/unUej4WhpB

1355972873459015683 2021-01-31 15:15:00 -0400 <POTUS> The sooner that we get our kids and educators back in the classroom, the sooner parents can go back to work — but we need the funding to do it. My American Rescue Plan will deliver much-needed support to our nation’s schools to help them reopen and operate safely.
1355918389655592962 2021-01-31 11:38:30 -0400 <POTUS> Millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck.

1355599663638970368 2021-01-30 14:32:00 -0400 <POTUS> Over the last 10 days, I’ve taken action on:  - COVID-19 - The economy - Climate change - Racial equity - Immigration - Health care  - LGBTQ+ rights  And I’m just getting started.
1355553863441543169 2021-01-30 11:30:00 -0400 <POTUS> $600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying your rent and putting food on the table. That’s why my American Rescue Plan finishes the job of getting $2,000 to folks who need it most.

1355292815203454980 2021-01-29 18:12:41 -0400 <POTUS> As Treasury Secretary @JanetYellen said during today’s meeting, the price of doing nothing when it comes to economic relief is too high. Congress must act quickly and pass the American Rescue Plan to deliver relief and help dig us out of this crisis.  https://t.co/5phSmHHnbp

1354221331605319681 2021-01-26 19:15:00 -0400 <POTUS> The fact is systemic racism touches every facet of American life, and everyone — no matter your race or ethnicity — benefits when we build a more equitable America.

1353898865754337281 2021-01-25 21:53:38 -0400 <POTUS> It's simple: When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy products made in America and support jobs here at home. My Buy American Executive Order does just that.  https://t.co/N6mZU6lBi5
