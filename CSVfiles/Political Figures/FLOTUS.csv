1379830922024001540 2021-04-07 12:18:22 -0400 <FLOTUS> How can we hope to keep our military strong if we don’t give our families, survivors and caregivers what they need to thrive? That’s what Joining Forces is all about.

1375576027682926592 2021-03-26 18:30:56 -0400 <FLOTUS> RIP Beverly Cleary. Millions of girls saw themselves in Ramona Quimby. Thank you from all the “pests” out there.
1375501462000840705 2021-03-26 13:34:38 -0400 <FLOTUS> We hope this virtual tour and teaching resource will help educators across the country shine a light on their powerful accomplishments.  And we hope this is only a beginning—that these women, and this exhibit, will inspire you to search deeper and keep learning every day.
1375501416505212928 2021-03-26 13:34:27 -0400 <FLOTUS> Women have always shaped our nation, but so often, their stories have gone untold.  This #WomensHistoryMonth, we’ve partnered with @Smithsonian and the @USEDGOV, to create a special exhibit here at the White House, honoring several ground-breaking women.  https://t.co/OA2muClltT
1375247698312491009 2021-03-25 20:46:16 -0400 <FLOTUS> Thinking of everyone in Alabama and all of those impacted by the severe weather across the South tonight. My prayers are with the grieving families. Please stay safe.  💕
1374874763068239875 2021-03-24 20:04:22 -0400 <FLOTUS> Equal work deserves equal pay.   Thank you @mPinoe and @100Purcent for joining us for #EqualPayDay.
1374822201979965444 2021-03-24 16:35:30 -0400 <FLOTUS> #EqualPayDay is personal to me.  https://t.co/dRdycY9J9w
1374483883379421202 2021-03-23 18:11:09 -0400 <FLOTUS> Ten more lives have been stolen by gun violence.   The grief we feel is heartbreakingly familiar, but we cannot become numb to it.  We must act now.
1374124469459976195 2021-03-22 18:22:58 -0400 <FLOTUS> Food insecurity plagues every corner of our country and we are working hard to address it. #HelpIsHere to put food on the table through the American Rescue Plan.
1374124221891186688 2021-03-22 18:21:59 -0400 <FLOTUS> It’s the stoic mother who says she’s not hungry at dinner so her kids won’t feel bad when she gives them her share. Or maybe it’s the person who lives half an hour from a grocery store, but can’t afford to get there.
1374123997172957185 2021-03-22 18:21:05 -0400 <FLOTUS> It’s the parent who just lost their job and quietly visits the food bank for groceries to get by. Or the child whose stomach growls until the teacher slips them a granola bar or apple to eat.
1374123852557524994 2021-03-22 18:20:31 -0400 <FLOTUS> It’s possible you may not even realize your friends and family could be suffering — because hunger is a silent agony.
1374123702980255746 2021-03-22 18:19:55 -0400 <FLOTUS> Millions of Americans, including millions of children, don’t have enough food to eat.  Some, because of the economic effects of COVID, are experiencing hunger for the very first time in their lives.
1373743286758764544 2021-03-21 17:08:17 -0400 <FLOTUS> Good luck to @NovaMBB! I’m cheering you on! 👏👏 #LetsMarchNova 🎉
1372993343081250817 2021-03-19 15:28:16 -0400 <FLOTUS> 100 million shots in arms…Hugs are coming.💕
1371950907403870213 2021-03-16 18:26:00 -0400 <FLOTUS> Said a quick ‘hi’ yesterday to the virtual students. Though with the American Rescue Plan, we’re going to open schools for in-person learning – and do it safely.  https://t.co/bSbskKaAmE
1371575556496494592 2021-03-15 17:34:29 -0400 <FLOTUS> With the American Rescue Plan, #HelpIsHere. We’re going to open schools—and we’re going to do it safely.  https://t.co/GuN0RlY4e5
1370376615369306114 2021-03-12 09:10:20 -0400 <FLOTUS> Military families’ devotion to our country is unshakeable and it’s vital that our work to support them is shaped by their voices. This week, I visited three U.S. military bases to hear directly from military families about what they’re facing and how we can help.  https://t.co/3EbjIKeY3b
1370175488837230594 2021-03-11 19:51:07 -0400 <FLOTUS> 50 days. Help is here.
1369111626889191424 2021-03-08 21:23:43 -0400 <FLOTUS> It’s more important than ever that we take steps to lift up and empower women and girls everywhere.   On #InternationalWomensDay, we are celebrating the establishment of the Gender Policy Council that will do just that.
1368911572870045706 2021-03-08 08:08:46 -0400 <FLOTUS> On this #InternationalWomensDay,  we celebrate the resilience and courage of women everywhere.   “Each time a woman stands up for herself...she stands up for all women.” - Maya Angelou
1367255290580766724 2021-03-03 18:27:18 -0400 <FLOTUS> We all want to get our kids back to school. @SecCardona and I got to see first-hand today what safety measures schools in CT and PA have implemented to stay open during COVID.  https://t.co/R9sooCHddS
1366124764700540929 2021-02-28 15:34:59 -0400 <FLOTUS> Last week in Texas, the President and I saw the best of the American people. Watching everyone come together to support one another in times of crisis gave me so much hope.  https://t.co/whjOiJWxTe
1365466795595886595 2021-02-26 20:00:27 -0400 <FLOTUS> Join us here for our first performance in the White House in honor of Black History Month.  https://t.co/hEA3SPCG5D

1362562862045093896 2021-02-18 19:41:16 -0400 <FLOTUS> The #NASAPerseverance has officially landed on Mars! Congratulations to everyone involved. You’ve showed us today that anything is possible.
1362473191994777608 2021-02-18 13:44:57 -0400 <FLOTUS> My heart is with you. Today, it’s more important than ever for us to support one another. If you’re able, please check in on friends and family and lend a hand wherever you can.

1359851341775052805 2021-02-11 08:06:39 -0400 <FLOTUS> On #WomenInScience Day, I’m thinking of Dr. Mae Jemison – the first Black woman in space. She pushes us to believe we are capable of more than we know: “I had to learn very early not to limit myself due to others' limited imaginations.”
1359601608607346695 2021-02-10 15:34:18 -0400 <FLOTUS> Everyone should have access to free community college.
1358543202907742212 2021-02-07 17:28:34 -0400 <FLOTUS> I’m cheering you on today, Sarah Thomas! 🎉 #SuperBowl  https://t.co/eh2XCjBWxq

1357402880714637316 2021-02-04 13:57:20 -0400 <FLOTUS> Cancer can be such a lonely, difficult journey for patients, loved ones who care for them, and the providers and researchers who work hard for them.   On #WorldCancerDay, I want you to know Joe and I are here for you and will never stop fighting for you.  https://t.co/UL9QZtGEgC
1356384819547164674 2021-02-01 18:31:56 -0400 <FLOTUS> “While we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us.” – @TheAmandaGorman #BlackHistoryMonth
1355328818614034441 2021-01-29 20:35:45 -0400 <FLOTUS> Military children serve, too. That’s what student mentors from @MilitaryChild shared with me. From helping new students feel welcome with virtual game nights to sharing snacks after school, these resilient kids are using their own experiences as military children to help others.
1353887451736059904 2021-01-25 21:08:17 -0400 <FLOTUS> Meeting today with the spouses of Democratic and Republican governors gave me so much hope for our future.   I know we can – and will – heal our country together.  https://t.co/WDg0ga8gmW
1353750624446394369 2021-01-25 12:04:34 -0400 <FLOTUS> Champ and Major have joined us in the White House! 💕🐾  https://t.co/R035YnavVo

1352781093842391040 2021-01-22 19:52:00 -0400 <FLOTUS> With all my heart — thank you to the National Guard for your continuous commitment to keeping our nation safe.  https://t.co/L7VRqWTfyc
1352749963504189442 2021-01-22 17:48:18 -0400 <FLOTUS> Cancer touches so many families.
